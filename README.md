RAA
===============

### Pronounced _RAAAH!_ Like a ferocious lion.

R client library for the Adobe Analytics 1.4 API, currently in beta, but due out in Feb 2014.

Get in touch with me if you're interested in using it. It is functional, but has not been extensively tested.

This library borrows from [Randy Zwitch's](https://github.com/randyzwitch) [RSiteCatalyst](https://github.com/randyzwitch/RSiteCatalyst) for the v1.3 API.

## Installation

RAA is in development, and is not on CRAN. You will need to install directly from GitHub.

First, install and load [devtools](https://www.google.com):

```
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
```
And then run _install_github_ to load _RAA_.
```
install_github("RAA","willempaling")
```
