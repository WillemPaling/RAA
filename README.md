RAA
===============

R client library for the Adobe Analytics 1.4 API - the API is currently in beta, and this library is in alpha! 
Get in touch with me if you're interested in using it.

For a production version of an R API to access the 1.3 API, you're better off using https://github.com/randyzwitch/RSiteCatalyst
